# MUGSHOTGAN
a colab notebook to see what a version of you or someone you know might look behind the camera of local authorities.

I apologize for the very disorganazed and redundant parts of the colab. If I come up with cleaner solutions I will keep updating them.

All though this is the very first repository I created going in very happy, most of the code is taking verbatim from other sources, which I link in the colab and here as well with deep gratitude.

Please forgive me if I am using the platform incorrectly.
